# Effective-Index-for-2D-Rib-Waveguide.
This project is a comsol Multiphysics simulation for the 2D Rib Waveguide.
The Rib structure and the Parametric sweep are refrenced from the paper:
(Full vectorial finite-element-based imaginary distance beam propagation solution of complex modes in optical waveguides, 2022), Ieeexplore.ieee.org. 2022.
In this simulation we shall sweep on D (Shown in the structure's Geometry) and result the effective refractive index for varius Ds (core heights) and visualize the resultant confinend electric field for these varius effective indices.
The refractive indices of the guiding,and substrate regions are 3.44 and 3.4 respectively (all parameters used are illustrated in comsol parameters )
